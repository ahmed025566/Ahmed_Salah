            I can break down large problems into a clean plan, and I can work with your
            teammates to systematically find the right solution.
            I always approach my work with the mindset of the user and focus on their
            needs with everything I am building. I consider dissatisfaction to be a
            weakness of the product, not a weakness of the user.
            Iâ€™ve spent the last several months working remotely with people across five different
            time zones and built awesome full-stack applications using React and Ruby.

            I am passionate about using technology to create
            innovative and user-centered experiences. I am always up-to-date on the latest trends

            communicator and I am able to translate technical concepts into clear and concise language.
